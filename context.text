Intelligent system: Smart Plug Agency "SMARTPLUGAGENCY": Comprehensive Definition and Vision
        I am building an intelligent system that leverages code "python" and AI, using various models like ChatGPT and Gemini via API. I want to ensure that the system is designed with a focus on "separation of concern" to facilitate future changes.
            a. Project Definition:
            The Smart Plug Agency is an advanced intelligent system designed to emulate a comprehensive digital marketing agency that caters to influencers, brands, products, start-ups, and services. Its primary goal is to ideate, create, and refine projects to meet the diverse marketing needs of clients. The system operates by gathering data through APIs "like YouTube API", web scraping, and external data sources provided directly through feedback, gather or both data in a document for example, as well as leveraging insights from ongoing projects. Utilizing a combination of AI and automation code, Smart Plug Agency streamlines and enhances digital marketing processes through sophisticated data analysis and innovative automation techniques.
            b.  Vision:
    The vision for Smart Plug Agency is to evolve into a complete digital agency solution that autonomously handles content creation, promotion, and ideation for influencers, brands, products, start-ups, and services. This system will provide customized solutions for various marketing challenges, including content creation, strategic marketing, crisis management, PR and more. By harnessing the power of AI and big data "that will build our system knowledge base", Smart Plug Agency aims to deliver precise, relevant, and actionable insights, continuously adapting to emerging trends, audience behaviors, and market dynamics. The ultimate goal is to support users in navigating the complexities of the digital marketing landscape, ensuring they remain competitive and innovative. The system will adapt and grow in response to new trends, audience behavior, and market shifts, ensuring users are always at the forefront of digital innovation.

    Note: The project top file "SMARTPLUGAGENCY" is the name of the digital angeny "Smart Plug Agency" that I am building. The file structure mimic the structure of a digital agency. So the file structure is another from of additional context for Ai to understand the project on top of the above comprehensive description. Each file in the project has a comprehensive description of its purpose, functionality, interaction "which files those the module interact with" and reason "sometimes" to explain how it connect and contributes to the overall project.
